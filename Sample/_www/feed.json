It's &quot;the email client for the rest of us&quot;.<\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/freron.com\/images\/MailMate_1024.png\" alt=\"\" \/>\n<p>Anyone out there remember <a href=\"https:\/\/inessential.com\/2010\/01\/16\/email_init\">Email init<\/a>? Which then became <a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2010\/01\/rage-against-the-mail-machine-the-genesis-of-letters\/\">Letters.app<\/a>? It was a project started by <a href=\"https:\/\/inessential.com\">Brent<\/a> in January 2010 to be<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>an email client that actually meets the needs of developers and professionals who rely on email, folks who type for a living.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If memory serves, and if Twitter would get their dumb act together and just show me <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lettersapp\/with_replies\">this timeline<\/a> in damn-chronological-not-algorithm-optimized-order, it looks like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lettersapp\/status\/7997921706\">Gruber took over<\/a> leading the project along with <a href=\"http:\/\/shapeof.com\">Gus<\/a> as technical lead. (And Brent being the honorary <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lettersapp\/status\/8034935623\">drink-buying chairman<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>I'm not sure when exactly the project died. The <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lettersapp\/status\/9553174156\">last tweet<\/a> was February 23 of that same year. And the last real web mention about the project I've been able to find is Brent doing a mighty good deed by <a href=\"https:\/\/inessential.com\/2014\/07\/08\/lettersapp_com_domain_auction_for_app_ca\">auctioning off the domain name<\/a> for <a href=\"https:\/\/appcamp4girls.com\">App Camp For Girls<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We can all dream about what could have been: a truly Mac-native email client for power users. Or, you could just use MailMate right now.<\/p>\n<p>MailMate is a glorious, configurable, ultimate-nerd-dream of an email client built just for macOS. I first discovered it back in 2013 when Benny did an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/mailmate-2-0\/\">Indiegogo campaign<\/a> to fund full-time development of the app. I was more than happy to throw in for a license key of my own to help keep the project moving forward.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MailMateGogo.png\" width=\"2418\" height=\"2578\" \/>\n<p>I'm thrilled to say that six years later, MailMate is still going strong. I use it every day in conjunction with <a href=\"https:\/\/tyler.io\/switching-email-providers\/\">Fastmail<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tyler.io\/sanebox-review\/\">SaneBox<\/a> to give me email super powers.<\/p>\n<p>Why is MailMate so great? A lot of folks I've recommended it to (ok, <em>forced upon<\/em>, really) said &quot;Eeeewwwww&quot; when they tried it. And I'll be the first to admit it's not the prettiest app, but it does feel at home and serviceable on macOS. And then, of course, it does have a hell of a learning curve for an email client compared to most others. But the killer feature?<\/p>\n<p>It just fucking works.<\/p>\n<p>And <em>believe<\/em> me. I've tried every single email client for Mac and iOS - paid apps, free apps, subscription apps, apps from small companies, and apps from giant corporations. There are exceptions, of course, but most are mediocre. Nice to look at, a few clever features maybe, but they all almost universally fall apart when dealing with 15+ years of emails unless they rely on a server-side component to do the bulk of the work. And in 2020, is asking a piece of software to handle a few gigs of text and a ridiculously complicated networking protocol really <em>that<\/em> difficult?<\/p>\n<p>Actually, yes, yes it is that difficult. I can attest to that based on the six months I lived off of <a href=\"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/tylerhall\/status\/607711838030069760\">a disaster of an iOS email client I wrote and suffered through myself<\/a>.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/zero-email-twitter.jpg\" width=\"1188\" height=\"516\" \/>\n<p>So I have the utmost respect and amazement for just how incredible a job Benny has done with MailMate. In a single app, he has<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built the most <em>stable<\/em> email client I've ever used<\/li>\n<li>Built the <em>fastest<\/em> email client I've ever used<\/li>\n<li>Built the most <em>powerful<\/em> email client I've ever used<\/li>\n<li>Built the <em>nerdiest<\/em> email client I've ever used<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you can just get past the initial configuration and learning curve and join the Religion of Plain Text Email Composition, you'll find a desktop email app that wipes the floor with the usual competition.<\/p>\n<p>The whole modus operandi of MailMate is its use of smart folders \/ searches \/ filters \/ etc for reading your email and plain text for composing messages.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MailMate only allows emails to be written using a plain text editor. It is important to understand that this is a feature of MailMate. It might even be its most defining feature.<\/p>\n<p>Plain text is whatever text you can write with your keyboard. This means that you cannot visually emphasize words, create outlines, create links, and insert images within the text editor itself, for example, by clicking buttons. Instead, you can (optionally) use the simple Markdown syntax. This is then automatically converted by MailMate to HTML which is the (unofficial) standard for rich text emails. MailMate automatically shows you a preview of the email and this is what most recipients of your emails are going to see.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve always been a nerd about the emails I write and have adamantly refused to send HTML email unless absolutely necessary. I totally understand the need for businesses (<a href=\"https:\/\/clickontyler.com\">like mine<\/a>) to send styled advertisements (I <em>hate<\/em> it, but I get it), but for a normal person just <em>writing<\/em> emails there\u2019s no need. Plain text FTW.<\/p>\n<p>As for smart mailboxes<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MailMate encourages the use of so-called \u201csmart\u201d mailboxes. These are virtual mailboxes which show messages which belong to a specified set of mailboxes and which match some set of conditions. When handling a new message in the Inbox, the basic decision to make is whether it should be archived or trashed. The rest should be handled by smart mailboxes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And those conditions can be layered on-top of one another and combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/manual.mailmate-app.com\/view\">powerful search strings<\/a> to create the perfect smart mailbox that you refer to frequently or just to help find a long lost email from a decade ago. Just look at this beautiful example from the help manual:<\/p>\n<p><code>foo f !smith t (smith or joe)<\/code><\/p>\n<p>This means:<\/p>\n<p><code>Message contains \u201cfoo\u201d and From does not contain \u201csmith\u201d and (To contains \u201csmith\u201d or \u201cjoe\u201d)<\/code><\/p>\n<p>And as for searching and filtering by date, holy crap:<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MailMateDates.png\" width=\"1446\" height=\"1314\" \/>\n<p>And just like best-of-breed Mac apps, MailMate supports a plethora of keyboard shortcuts that let you plow through and triage your email without reaching for the mouse. You can do the usual commands such as archive, flag, delete, mark as read, mark as junk, etc. But then you can also hit \u21e7\u2318M to bring up a filterable list of all your mailboxes and effortlessly move the current message (or messages). And \u2318T will similarly let you go to another mailbox.<\/p>\n<p>And the keyboard shortcuts don\u2019t stop there. You can also assign them to any of the plugins or 3rd party scripts you\u2019ve installed.<\/p>\n<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did I just say <em>plugins and scripts<\/em>? Yep, MailMate is wide open for you to run custom actions and perform tasks.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MailMateBundles.png\" width=\"1604\" height=\"1556\" \/>\n<p>I\u2019ve installed plugins for sending emails to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.omnigroup.com\/omnifocus\">OmniFocus<\/a> as new tasks, archiving into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.devontechnologies.com\/apps\/devonthink\">DEVONthink<\/a>, and editing replies with <a href=\"https:\/\/macromates.com\">TextMate<\/a>. I even wrote my own plugin that grabs the sender of the current email and opens a browser window showing me that customer\u2019s order history and previous support requests in my backend system.<\/p>\n<p>The final feature I\u2019ll highlight is <a href=\"https:\/\/manual.mailmate-app.com\/preferences\">how customizable notifications are<\/a>.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MailMateNotifications.png\" width=\"1284\" height=\"848\" \/>\n<p>For each mailbox (not just <em>account<\/em>, but any <em>mailbox<\/em>) you can decide to show a Notification Center alert, a count in the menu bar, or a Dock badge. MailMate supports showing four different dock badges at once (one per corner). You can also choose what information is shown in Notification Center alerts and pick a custom sound. Or any of those in any combination.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what else to say except that I love this app so much.

Let me start from the beginning...<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have an exact date, but within the last week I realized that I was unable to <code>ssh<\/code> into my primary web server - the one that runs my <a href=\"https:\/\/clickontyler.com\">business website<\/a>, activation server, etc. It\u2019s sort of the linchpin for my tiny software company. When it goes down, I get worried.<\/p>\n<p>At first I thought maybe the server was down? I hadn\u2019t received any alerts, so I did a quick check. And, yes, it was still up and running and serving web traffic. Ok, did <code>sshd<\/code> somehow become unresponsive? I login through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linode.com\">Linode<\/a> control panel and restart the service. Still can\u2019t login.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s odd. I don\u2019t get a connection refused. Not even a timeout. It just...hangs.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ssh1.png\" width=\"1241\" height=\"311\" \/>\n<p>That\u2019s the <code>ssh<\/code> output with the verbose flag. Nothing. I waited 10+ minutes and it never timed out or produced any other output.<\/p>\n<p>I reboot the server itself and the problem persists.<\/p>\n<p>Then, I notice some more oddities. I\u2019m able to connect using <a href=\"https:\/\/binarynights.com\">ForkLift<\/a> - my FTP client, which connects via SFTP. Also, <a href=\"http:\/\/sequelpro.com\">SequelPro<\/a> is able to connect to MySQL via <code>ssh<\/code> as well.<\/p>\n<p>And then things get even stranger. This is all happening on my iMac. I try connecting from my laptop, and it works. My MacBook Pro is at home right next to my iMac, which is refusing to login. They\u2019re both on the same wifi and thus the same IP. So, it can\u2019t be that my home IP address got mistakenly banned somehow.<\/p>\n<p>Next, I <code>ssh<\/code> into a different server and then hop to the problematic one. It connects without any trouble. At this point I\u2019m thinking maybe the permissions on my local private key got screwed up. So, I blow away <code>~\/.ssh<\/code> and recreate all of my keys from a backup. Still can\u2019t login.<\/p>\n<p>Ok. I think about it for a few minutes and then - aha! - I have an Ubuntu virtual machine running on this iMac inside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parallels.com\">Parallels<\/a>. I\u2019ll <code>ssh<\/code> into it and then try and connect. That will rule out if there\u2019s just something odd about my iMac\u2019s LAN IP. (To be clear, my home network is perfectly ordinary. Just a cable modem and a router.) So, I login to the VM, try and connect, and it works fine.<\/p>\n<p>At this point here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>My iMac is the only machine that cannot login.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019ve connected successfully from behind the same public IP using a laptop, a virtual machine, <em>and<\/em> my iPhone and iPad.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019ve verified my <code>ssh<\/code> keys are correct and have the appropriate permissions.<\/li>\n<li>I <em>can<\/em> connect to other servers from the problematic machine - both at the same hosting provider (Linode) and others (AWS and DigitalOcean).<\/li>\n<li>I <em>can<\/em> connect from my iMac if I jump through any other server, first.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I start trying to think what could possibly be different about this one machine. And then it dawns on me. This all started around the time I updated my iMac to 10.15.4. My laptop is still on 10.15.3 - and, of course, the virtual machine isn\u2019t macOS at all.<\/p>\n<p>Totally grasping for straws I google for \u201c10.15.4 ssh\u201d and find <a href=\"https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/251226509\">this top result<\/a> on the Apple discussion forums:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Catalina 10.15.4 SSH port &gt; 8192 does not work when using server name instead of IP<\/p>\n<p>This issue started just after upgrading to macOS Catalina 10.15.4.<\/p>\n<p>After that update I am no longer able to open a SSH connection to a port greater than 8192 using server name (instead of IP). Yes, I do change the port on the server side prior to every test.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>That can\u2019t possibly be real?<\/p>\n<p>Up until this point, I was connecting via a saved hostname defined in my <code>~\/.ssh\/config<\/code>, which let me login simply by tying <code>ssh some-server<\/code>. So, I tried <code>ssh ip-address -p9944<\/code> and it worked! (That server runs on an alternate <code>ssh<\/code> port.)<\/p>\n<p>Ok. Time to narrow this down a bit further. I changed the server to listen on standard port 22 and tried connecting via the hostname once again.<\/p>\n<p>Holy crap, it worked.<\/p>\n<p>The user in the Apple forums was right. At least in my case, my one server that happened to be running on a non-standard <code>ssh<\/code> port above 8192 will not connect from Catalina 10.15.4 when using the hostname instead of the IP address.<\/p>\n<p>Just to verify, I boot up a Mojave and Catalina (10.15.3) VM on the same iMac.

If you have young children, it is not acceptable for the internet to blip out, slow down, or for a favorite movie to be pulled due to licensing issues between international billionaires, so having a locally, always available copy is critical.<\/p>\n<p>My setup has stayed pretty consistent the last few years. I keep Plex running on my iMac Pro, which is great because it\u2019s always awake and online. Even better, it can handle multiple transcoding sessions without breaking a sweat. So even if both my kids are watching something on their devices and my wife on the TV, I can be working in Xcode and not even notice the iMac doing anything different. It works so well, in fact, that I even invited our parents and siblings to our Plex account so they can watch our library remotely.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>only<\/em> downside to this setup is that all this content is stored on an 8TB external drive hanging off the back of the iMac. And that\u2019s fine, except...it\u2019s <em>loud<\/em>. We\u2019re talking late 90s beige tower clicking hard drive loud. The noise hasn\u2019t been an issue previously because my kids\u2019 movie watching and my time at my desk only overlapped on the weekends. But now that schools are closed and the world is working from home, I can hear it chewing through data all damn day.<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have a NAS and I don\u2019t really want to buy or deal with one. So, I bought my first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\">Raspberry Pi<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pimylifeup.com\/raspberry-pi-samba\/\">installed Samba<\/a>, and moved it and the noisy drive inside a bookcase next to the router. And because it\u2019s hardwired and not going over wifi, LAN bandwidth isn\u2019t an issue as the videos round trip from Plex on my iMac, to the Pi, then back to Plex, then to whatever device is being watched. <em>Yeeesh<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But all that video and music being available to Plex requires macOS not lose the connection to the file server. You can make a share automatically mount at startup by dragging it to your user\u2019s login items in System Preferences, but that doesn\u2019t help if the connection randomly drops.<\/p>\n<p>I found a few 3rd party solutions to keep network shares mounted - I paid for and gave <a href=\"https:\/\/automounter.app\">this one<\/a> a try. It\u2019s really nice! But at the end of the day that\u2019s just one more app running in the background I didn\u2019t want - two, if you count the extra <a href=\"https:\/\/automounter.app\/helper\/\">helper app<\/a> you have to install so it can work around macOS\u2019s sandboxing restrictions. (Not the developer\u2019s fault.)<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I thought about it for a few minutes and realized I should have just written my own script to start with. Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/tylerhall\/1ac0b787d1b7966fcf8bf554a13d42e5\">the literal two lines of <code>bash<\/code> I ended up writing<\/a>:<\/p>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/tylerhall\/1ac0b787d1b7966fcf8bf554a13d42e5.js\"><\/script>\n<p>That checks to see if the share is mounted (if the directory for it exists) and, if not, mounts it.<\/p>\n<p>Throw that in a <code>cron<\/code> job every minute or so and \ud83d\udca5.

Most of them are small utilities that do a very specific thing that make my life easier. While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/tylerhall\">others are more ambitious<\/a>. In any case, it\u2019s another week, we\u2019re all stuck inside, so here\u2019s another app that I built two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/gum.co\/UoYGv\">Spotish<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a dead-simple and slightly dumb Mac menu bar app for Spotify - there are many like it, but this one is mine. Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve probably tried a dozen open source, free, and\/or inexpensive Spotify \u201cmini players\u201d - many of them on the Mac App Store. But I\u2019m picky, and none of them behaved exactly the way I wanted. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m after...<\/p>\n<p>I hardly ever listen to <em>my<\/em> music with Spotify or any other streaming service. The music I care about - my collection of 40,000 mp3s dating back to CDs I ripped in high school and have since carried across twenty different computers - are all stored on a file server at home and available wherever I am via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.plex.tv\">Plex<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/prism-music.app\">Prism<\/a>. If I\u2019m listening to <em>my<\/em> music, I know exactly what\u2019s playing at any given moment. I\u2019m sure you do, too. There\u2019s no surprises.<\/p>\n<p>But I use Spotify, and <a href=\"https:\/\/tyler.io\/missing-rdio-and-making-the-best-of-apple-music-with-shortcuts\/\">previously Rdio and Apple Music<\/a>, for <em>discovery<\/em>. I\u2019m constantly streaming playlists of recommended artists and albums I\u2019ve never heard before - always listening for something new.<\/p>\n<p>Given that finding something new and amazing is my number one reason for using any streaming service, I\u2019m constantly pausing what I\u2019m doing and breaking my flow to quickly glance and see what I\u2019m listening to. And nowadays there is. So. Much. Friction. just to see what is currently playing.<\/p>\n<p>Every music service uses their own awful website disguised as a desktop app. Even on my iMac Pro - and <em>especially<\/em> on an underpowered laptop - checking the current track feels equivalent to launching Creative Suite in the 2000s. I just want to see the song title - not launch a entire instance of Chromium.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a long time I used various 3rd party apps to keep a floating window of artwork on my desktop. Some were really nice. But they were always a pain in the ass to reveal. I\u2019d typically have to \u2318-tab through twenty open apps just to bring it to the front. And it always bothered my obsessive compulsive nature having an extra window cluttering up my screen when I prefer to only have windows belonging to the current task visible. (Yes, I\u2019m crazy.)<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, like any good developer who practices <a href=\"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/tylerhall\/status\/1139962457995251712\">Hate Driven Development<\/a>, I decided to build a Spotify mini player that behaves exactly how I want. Here\u2019s a screenshot:<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-bar1.jpeg\" width=\"1501\" height=\"183\" \/>\n<p>Everything I want to know - right there in the menu bar...<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Artist<\/li>\n<li>Album title<\/li>\n<li>Song title<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, the text is nearly incomprehensibly tiny, but I dig it. It crams all the pertinent info into a small space and it makes me happy because I can glance up the menu bar at any time no matter what I\u2019m doing or what context I\u2019m in.<\/p>\n<p>But if that font makes your eyes bleed (I get it), you can add\/remove song items in any combination. So, just the artist and album names?<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-bar2.jpeg\" width=\"1501\" height=\"183\" \/>\n<p>Or just the song title?<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-bar3.jpeg\" width=\"1501\" height=\"183\" \/>\n<p>Spotish does some other nice things, too, besides just displaying the song info. The background animates to show the song\u2019s progress...<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-progreses.gif\" width=\"1304\" height=\"174\" \/>\n<p>Click to view the album artwork...<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-artwork.jpeg\" width=\"1501\" height=\"782\" \/>\n<p>Clicking the image will launch Spotify and display the song in the context of its album.<\/p>\n<p>Or, you can control-click (right click) the menu bar item to play \/ pause Spotify directly.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, there\u2019s a few preferences to tweak to your liking...<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-prefs.png\" width=\"1104\" height=\"868\" \/>\n<p>But my favorite feature? The one that really makes my geek gears turn? Spotish integrates with <a href=\"https:\/\/getdrafts.com\">Drafts.app<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Shift-click on the menu bar item and Spotish will create a new draft in Drafts with all of the current song\u2019s info as well as a shareable link to its page on spotify.com<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/spotish-drafts.2020-03-25-00_26_57.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"548\" \/>\n<p>It\u2019s a fast and completely frictionless way for me to bookmark or remember songs I want to take a closer look at later. (Yes, Spotify lets you \u2764\ufe0f songs. And you could always add it to a \u201cListen To\u201d playlist. But this is faster for me and fits my personal workflow better as I often want to <em>do something<\/em> with the song\u2019s info as opposed to merely just liking it.)<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83c\udfb5 \ud83c\udf89<\/h2>\n<p>So, that\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/gum.co\/UoYGv\">Spotish<\/a>. I love having it in my menu bar. Maybe you will, too?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to give it a spin, I\u2019m trying something new. <a href=\"https:\/\/gum.co\/UoYGv\">Pay-what-you-want<\/a> and you\u2019ll get a download link in your email as well as future app updates.<\/p>\n<p>One dollar? Works for me.<\/p>\n<p>$1,337? That\u2019d be cool, too.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever amount you\u2019d like to contribute to Spotish\u2019s future development, if you\u2019re not happy, just let me know and I\u2019ll refund your purchase.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gumroad.com\/js\/gumroad.js\"><\/script>\n<a class=\"gumroad-button\" href=\"https:\/\/gum.co\/UoYGv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy Spotish Now<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p>Questions?

So I built it, have been using it, and I'm now putting it out there.<\/p>\n<p>It's called <em>Three Things Today<\/em>.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/three-things-app-icon.png\" width=\"512\" height=\"512\" \/>\n<p>That's it's full name.

That\u2019s not its purpose. <em>Three Things<\/em> supplements those other apps. It's what I use to plan my days and weeks at a level above the nitty gritty details that OmniFocus handles, but not quite as high up as what you might call your &quot;life goals&quot;.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/three-things-ss1.png\" width=\"1737\" height=\"1400\" \/>\n<h2>My System<\/h2>\n<p>Feel free to skip ahead to the details about the app below, but it'll probably make more sense if you stick with me just a bit longer so I can explain how I personally get things done and how <em>Three Things<\/em> helps.<\/p>\n<p>Every day, amidst the usual responsibilities of two young kids, chores at home, finding five minutes to actually talk to my wife, bug reports and dev work from my day job, etc., my goal is to accomplish three things. Sometimes even just two. Maybe.<\/p>\n<p>They don't have to be anything seriously big, time consuming, or significant. Just three things that move forward whatever current projects or goals I'm focusing on. Often times they'll be related to <a href=\"https:\/\/clickontyler.com\">my software business<\/a> or other freelance work. Other times it might be an errand that I've been putting off or some skunkworks development I want to do for my day job.<\/p>\n<p>But if I can go to bed at night knowing that along with the chaos of a career, family, and every day life, I did something <em>else<\/em>, I'll feel good.<\/p>\n<p>So, I plan out my days - usually seven to ten days in advance - each with the two or three tasks I hope to accomplish. Basically, this splits each day into thirds. I try to do one thing in the morning, another around lunch, and one more after work. Often times, though, I'll get busy and wind up taking care of stuff after everyone else has gone to bed.<\/p>\n<p>The point of this system isn't to be rigid. It's not a todo list with hard deadlines. More than anything else it\u2019s flexible and <em>forgiving<\/em>. It lets me look ahead into the near future and see what's on the horizon, and, more importantly, know if I'm over committed. Knowing that I can do at most three things each day - usually just two - and having everything stacked up in front of me day-by-day is illuminating.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macsparky.com\/about\">David Sparks<\/a> has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macsparky.com\/blog\/2018\/2\/the-hyper-scheduling-experiment\">written<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macsparky.com\/blog\/2018\/3\/hyper-scheduling-feedback\">extensively<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.macsparky.com\/courses\/shortcuts13\/lectures\/11588365\">about<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macsparky.com\/blog\/2019\/2\/hyper-scheduling-without-making-yourself-crazy\">his move to block (n\u00e9e, hyper) scheduling<\/a>. This is a similar system - my own take on it that just happens to use a bespoke Mac (and iOS?) app molded around my workflow. Oh, and to steal a quote from David just so we\u2019re all on the same page about this type of system:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve received lots of affirmation from readers that have been doing this in some form or another for years and ask me, in one way or another, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Some folks call it block scheduling, others call it fancier things like value-based time management. I'm certainly not the first guy to this party, and I find that comforting.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Three Things.app<\/h2>\n<p>So what is <em>Three Things<\/em>? Well, it\u2019s a calendar that lets you schedule tasks on each day. It\u2019s meant to be excruciatingly pragmatic and realistic about how life works. (At least my life.) It literally will not allow you to schedule more than three tasks per day.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s very important and also the point of this system. I already have over a decade\u2019s worth of habits, workflows, and actions in OmniFocus using various combinations of defer and due dates to keep me on track. <em>Three Thigns<\/em> lets me plan and schedule my near-term road ahead and enforces restrictions that make sure I don\u2019t overbook myself. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s <em>pragmatic<\/em>. I built it knowing that even on my best of days, I\u2019m at most going to have the time and energy to do three things on top of the rest of life\u2019s commitments.<\/p>\n<p>I also intentionally described the app as <em>realistic<\/em>. That\u2019s the other key feature of the app. I know (and <em>Three Things<\/em> knows) that life happens. That <em>shit<\/em> happens. Some tasks will take longer than I expect. And some days a fire will break out at work and I\u2019ll have time for nothing else. And yet other days I just won\u2019t be feeling it and would rather take a mental vacation. So, I do.<\/p>\n<p>On those days, <em>Three Things<\/em> has your back because of two magical menu items:<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/three-things-defer-menu.png\" width=\"838\" height=\"311\" \/>\n<p>If a task just didn\u2019t get done or you skipped it - hit \u2318D and <em>Three Things<\/em> will automatically move it to your next available slot in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Every task management app has a feature that will let you postpone, delay, or snooze a task. You can tell them to push a todo item out by a day or a week, etc. But I like to think <em>Three Things<\/em> is smarter than that. Because the app knows that you can only do two or three things a day - and because it enforces that rule - the app knows when you do and do not have time available. So when you defer a task, it won\u2019t accidentally reschedule it for a day that\u2019s already overflowing with commitments. Instead, it smartly places it on a day that\u2019s free.<\/p>\n<p>But what about that \u201cDefer All Tasks\u201d menu item? Glad you asked.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming you\u2019ve scheduled your tasks in a mostly chronological order in which they need to be accomplished, then simply postponing one of them can delay others. I don\u2019t want to get too far into the weeds of making one task depend strictly on another, but as an example: I often schedule out large app features I\u2019m working on in bite sized pieces across a number of days. If you know how software development works, then you\u2019ll know that you can\u2019t normally just rearrange the order of those tasks.<\/p>\n<p>So, with <em>Three Things<\/em>, when you defer all your tasks, the app will take all incomplete items scheduled today and in the future, and push them all ahead by one day.<\/p>\n<p>But!<\/p>\n<p>Some tasks really are due on a specific day. Again, I\u2019m not trying to make this app a full-blow task management solution. I already have OmniFocus for that. But, each task can optionally be marked as deferrable or not.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/three-things-defer.gif\" width=\"599\" height=\"396\" \/>\n<p>If a task can\u2019t be deferred, i.e., if it truly is due on a specific date, then when you defer everything else, all of you other items will flow around your scheduled tasks as appropriate. Your fixed-date commitments will stay put and the app will assume everything else is flexible and rescheduled them appropriately.<\/p>\n<p>The way it works for me is before I shut down for the day (or sometimes before I get started the next morning), if there\u2019s anything that didn\u2019t get taken care of, I can <em>defer all<\/em> and <em>Three Things<\/em> fixes my schedule for me.<\/p>\n<h2>I know what you\u2019re about to ask: Why not just use a calendar you weirdo?<\/h2>\n<p>Because that\u2019s for things that have a scheduled time or hard due date. Because calendars are <em>sacred<\/em> ground that shan\u2019t be fucked with or else they become meaningless. I\u2019ve attempted to put my higher-level tasks onto a separate calendar alongside my real appointments, but it\u2019s always too fiddly. Calendar apps are great at being calendars. But they\u2019re almost universally lousy when it comes to todo lists. And in my case it\u2019s even worse because the things I\u2019m throwing at them don\u2019t really belong on a specific date and don\u2019t fall into the Reminders.app bucket either.<\/p>\n<p>And dedicated task management apps are built for the individual items and low-level details of what needs to be done and in what order, etc.<\/p>\n<p><em>Three Things<\/em> isn\u2019t either of those. It\u2019s also not a project management app or a bug tracker. It\u2019s not a Kanban board or a backlog.<\/p>\n<p>By and large, everything I put into it is flexible and malleable. Its contents can mostly be shifted around, delayed, and rescheduled without consequence. I primarily use it to see how booked I am and to break down larger chunks of work into manageable pieces that could still themselves contain smaller actions.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, it fits my brain. Maybe it\u2019ll fit yours, too.<\/p>\n<h2>Current status of Three Things<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m making <em>Three Things<\/em> available today for anyone to download and use. For now, the app is completely free. And that\u2019s because while the app works, it still lacks polish, may or may not contain horrible-awful bugs, and is still missing a few small features I want to add before calling it one-point-oh.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, the app is missing the ability to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorder tasks within a day. The plumbing and UI work is done - as you\u2019ll see when you drag tasks from one day to another - but when you drop a task onto another day, it just positions it after any existing items on that day.<\/li>\n<li>Assigning colors to tasks. Currently, all tasks are the same shade of blue.<\/li>\n<li>An iOS version. I 100% plan on making an iOS companion app - especially because I want that for myself. No ETA on that yet.<\/li>\n<li>Other random UI niceties and polish.<\/li>\n<li>Data export. I have no intention of locking away your data in a proprietary format. The app will absolutely support importing\/exporting everything as JSON and\/or possibly a standard calendar feed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Things that do work:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly everything involving the day to day use of the app. You should be able to schedule new tasks, drag them to other days, mark them complete, and defer them. If any of that feels broken or I missed an edge case, I\u2019d love to know.<\/li>\n<li>iCloud sync! Yep, everything will stay in sync across all of your Macs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, assuming at least one other person besides myself expresses interest in this app, I do plan on charging for it eventually.

Now, I don\u2019t want to be too hard on myself  - no one can be an expert in every nook and cranny of a tech stack as large as AppKit. But, still, this one <em>really<\/em> knocked me on my butt when I realized my mistake.<\/p>\n<p>Tonight I tweeted <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tylerhall\/status\/1239734350532546565\">this<\/a>...<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In today's exciting episode of Tyler is a Professional Software Developer\u2122...<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/stackview-commit.jpg\" width=\"1344\" height=\"216\" \/>\n<p>The bug I was running into happened when I dragged an <code>NSTextField<\/code> out of an <code>NSStackView<\/code> and dropped it elsewhere in the window. In the gif below you\u2019ll see that after the drop completes, the <code>NSTextField<\/code> lingers behind - continuing to duplicate each time I drag  and drop it.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/stackview-drag1.2020-03-16-22_14_06.gif\" width=\"450\" height=\"373\" \/>\n<p>Note: Only the <em>original<\/em> <code>NSTextField<\/code> is draggable. The copies left behind don\u2019t accept mouse events.<\/p>\n<p>So, I start debugging this. My first thought is there\u2019s some sort of race condition happening because when I drop the <code>NSTextField<\/code>, the change persists to my Core Data stack - which does the usual <code>NSManagedObjectContext<\/code> merge dance and then posts a notification letting the other views in the window know there\u2019s new data and they should refresh. (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the proper way to do it, but it\u2019s how I approached it in this situation.)<\/p>\n<p>That notification \u2192 refresh isn\u2019t necessarily anything crazy or complex, but once the change finishes persisting to Core Data, my CloudKit code picks up the new data and pushes it up to the customer\u2019s iCloud account. I don\u2019t just do a push to CloudKit, though. The data model for this app is very, very tiny. So, I\u2019m saving myself some added complexity and just doing an actual two-way sync each time. And, of course, when the sync completes - \ud83d\udca5 - my views are told to reload any additional changes from the sync session.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve messed up code like this plenty of times before and I\u2019m hoping my first instinct is correct and I\u2019m somehow maybe adding an extra copy of the <code>NSTextField<\/code> twice to the <code>NSStackView<\/code>?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the pertinent code. It removes any existing tasks from the <code>NStackView<\/code> and then loops through the new data adding a view for each item back into the stack view.<\/p>\n<pre><code>        monthDayView.clearTasks()\n        for t in tasks {\n            let taskView = t.taskView()\n            monthDayView.stackView.addArrangedSubview(taskView)\n        }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Heres\u2019 the implementation for <code>clearTasks()<\/code> above:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    func clearTasks() {\n        for view in stackView.arrangedSubviews {\n            stackView.removeArrangedSubview(view)\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><em>(For the seasoned <code>NSStackView<\/code> readers out there who can already see the bug in my code, please hold your laughter while I explain the next frustrating hour of my evening in excruciating detail...)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Seems safe enough, right? But still, my eyes don\u2019t lie. There\u2019s clearly a duplicate <code>NSTextField<\/code> hanging around. Let\u2019s dig deeper.<\/p>\n<p>I start with the app in this state:<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/stackview-bug-count.png\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1844\" \/>\n<p>I add this debugging code to confirm if the stack views really do or do not have the number of arranged views I\u2019m expecting:<\/p>\n<pre><code>print(monthDayView.stackView.arrangedSubviews.count)\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In the screenshot above, March 18 is the \u201creal\u201d item, and the other three are the weird zombie copies.

Let\u2019s start from first principles and re-read the documentation.<\/p>\n<p>Relatively speaking, <code>NSStackView<\/code>  is a newish part of AppKit. It\u2019s only been around since Mac OS X (<em>not<\/em> macOS) 10.9 Mavericks. Regardless, in the seven years since then, I haven\u2019t ever really used it <em>that<\/em> often. I know it\u2019s there and a nice tool to have available, but I\u2019m just not super familiar with it. And as you\u2019ll soon see, even less so than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m reading through Apple\u2019s documentation in Xcode and I finally stumble upon <code>removeArrangedSubview(_:)<\/code>...<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/tyler.vhx.cloud:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/stackview-docs.png\" width=\"2356\" height=\"1406\" \/>\n<p>I think <em>that\u2019s strange for a seven year old API, but ok<\/em> and keep browsing.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly an hour later I\u2019m really questioning everything I thought I knew about ones and zeroes until a google search leads me to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackingwithswift.com\/read\/31\/4\/removing-views-from-a-uistackview-with-removearrangedsubview\">this page<\/a>. And, sure enough, my bug is spelled out right there:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, using <code>removeArrangedSubview()<\/code> <strong>doesn\u2019t<\/strong> remove the view altogether \u2013 it keeps the view in memory, which is helpful if you plan to re-add it later on because you can avoid recreating it. Here, though, we actually want to remove the web view and destroy it entirely, and that can be done with a call to <code>removeFromSuperview()<\/code> instead.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Holleeee crap. I never knew stack views worked that way. (Thanks, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/twostraws\">Paul<\/a>!) I mean, wow. That is a very basic misunderstanding on my part. So, I add one additional line of code:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    func clearTasks() {\n        for view in stackView.arrangedSubviews {\n            stackView.removeArrangedSubview(view)\n            view.removeFromSuperview()\n        }\n    }\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>and \ud83d\udca5 it works.

It should be cheaper and work with Arq , can I ask why you prefer B2?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I started to reply directly, but then like everything I write, it kept growing. And then I thought my answer might be interesting to others as well. So, here you go...<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hey. Glad you enjoyed the post. I've looked into <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/glacier\/\">Glacier<\/a> previously, but stick with B2 for a few reasons. Just specifically talking about my photos\/videos (not my actual computer backups which I do use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arqbackup.com\">Arq<\/a> for)...<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.backblaze.com\/b2\/cloud-storage.html\">B2<\/a> currently costs me $5\/month. <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/blogs\/aws\/new-amazon-s3-storage-class-glacier-deep-archive\/\">Glacier Deep Archive<\/a> would be $1.80\/month just for the storage.<\/p>\n<p>However, assuming I'm doing <a href=\"https:\/\/calculator.s3.amazonaws.com\/index.html\">Amazon's complicated pricing math<\/a> correctly, in the event of a full recovery, getting all of my data out of B2 would be $10. But a restore from Glacier would be $90.<\/p>\n<p>Do I expect to need to get all that data out very often? If ever? Hopefully not. And with my local backup and the fact the Google truly is super reliable despite me being paranoid, I haven't ever had to restore a single photo or video from B2 yet. It's purely my disaster recovery fallback.<\/p>\n<p>So, in theory. It would cost an extra $80 to restore out of Glacier, but be $3.20 cheaper per month for storage. $80 \/ $3.20 means I could do a full restore once every two years and break even compared to B2. And if I never did do a restore, I'd save $76 over the course of those two years.<\/p>\n<p>So now that I'm doing the math again, maybe Glacier <em>is<\/em> something to look into long-term as my storage needs keep rising. But, thankfully, I'm very fortunate that an extra $3\/month doesn't bother me enough to invest the time into migrating and figuring out an alternative to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backblaze.com\/b2\/docs\/quick_command_line.html\">B2's easy to use command line sync tool<\/a>. Does <a href=\"https:\/\/s3tools.org\/s3cmd\">s3cmd<\/a> offer similar functionality? Maybe? I've never looked to see if it does syncing. <em>Update: <a href=\"https:\/\/s3tools.org\/s3cmd-sync\">Yep, it does<\/a>. Nice.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, given all of the above and also your initial mention about how Arq would work with S3\/Glacier, I do want to point out that I'm not using Arq for my photos and videos.<\/p>\n<p>I do use Arq to backup my computers because I love having a way to restore specific versions of my files. And Arq's restore UI works terrifically. It's <a href=\"https:\/\/tyler.io\/gone\/\">saved my butt<\/a> a number of times.<\/p>\n<p>Also, because of bandwidth constraints, I can't actually use Arq for my giant, monthly photo and video backup job. Arq is a Mac app - so I'd have to run it at home behind my Comcast connection, which has terrible upload speeds. Sure, it'd be doable. But it's way, way faster to go datacenter to datacenter, which means I need to use a different tool.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of which, as I said above, I've never needed to restore my photos from B2 yet. But I do frequently grab old files (sometimes 100s of GB) with Arq. That sort of access with Glacier isn't cost effective - B2 is way cheaper. Also, B2 gives me instant access to my files whereas Glacier might require waiting 12 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, that's my calculus. I don't ever really foresee moving away from Arq + B2 unless Arq is discontinued or an even cheaper B2 competitor appears. But as my family archives keep growing and eventually cross into multiple TB, I may need to reconsider Glacier.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: If I totally screwed up the Glacier pricing, I'd love to hear about it. I estimated the costs of archiving and restoring a flat 1TB.<\/em><\/p>\n","summary":"<p>This is a quick followup to my post from this week about backing up my family\u2019s photos and home videos with Google Photos and B2.
